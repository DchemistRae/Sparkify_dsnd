# Sparkify User Churn Analysis and Prediction

Sparkify is a fictional music streaming service created by Udacity for this project. Here a dataset containing users activity was analysed to predict if a customer will churn at somepoint in time or stay with the service. This is important to identify users that might leave and offer them coupons of special promotions to get them to continue using sparkify music streaming service.
